# DS Tips
~~~
Approach:
~~~
* Read the Question until you understand it + 1 time.
* Write the scenarios & corner Cases
* Corner cases: Two Types
    * Question Corner Cases. Define them soon after understanding question.
    * Implementation Corner Case. Define them while/after writing the code.
* "DO NOT" start CODE until the above steps are clear
* Write pseudo code/implementation.
* Reherse the scenarios/corner cases on implementation.

# Things to remember:
~~~
Short Circuit
~~~
* The && and || operators "short-circuit", meaning they don't evaluate the right hand side if it isn't necessary. The & and | operators, when used as logical operators, always evaluate both sides.
~~~
Must Redos.
~~~
* SearchInRotatedArray: see if you can fit in right>left
* LinkedList Palindrome: 
    * check for middle element is odd or even. 
    * Do not use Queue with recursion. only use it with iteration else you will end up with checking a node against itself.
* Matrix Rotation: layer Rotation.
