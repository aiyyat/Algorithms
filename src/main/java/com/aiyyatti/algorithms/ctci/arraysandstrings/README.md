Tips:
## String
Note: Below are applicable where the order doesnt matter
~~~
Bit Operation on an Integer:
~~~
if the characaterset is a to z only? 
if it is case insensitive.
if the question involves finding the presence of a character - eg. if unique 

if the above is true there are only 26 characters. if so you can use an integer to represent the characters 
Question: can bit manipulation be done on long?

~~~
Additional Data structure:
~~~
if the characterset is more than just a to z
if it involves 128 or even 256 ascii characterset use an array of 128/256 length.

~~~
Sorting:
~~~ 
you may have to find the presence of a character unique 
if no additional DS is allowed
you can resort sorting the array(s) of characters and comparing by means of pointers.

#Matrix Rotation:
This is a tricky question, because intuition can go wrong
Steps: Rotate outer layer then rotate the inner layer and so on until you reach the middle most element (<N/2 where N is the length or height of the N*N Matrix).

#URLify:
Start from the end so that the shifts can be minimal.
