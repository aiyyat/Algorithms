#Tree 

##Binary Tree Traversal
~~~
Pre-Order Traversal
~~~
Process all nodes of a tree by processing the root, then recursively processing all subtrees. Also known as prefix traversal.
In short visit the current node before it's children.
~~~
In-Order Traversal
~~~
Process all nodes of a tree by recursively processing the left subtree, then processing the root, and finally the right subtree.
In short visit the left, current node and then the right nodes.
~~~
Post-Order Traversal
~~~
Process all nodes of a tree by recursively processing all subtrees, then finally processing the root. Also known as postfix traversal.
In short visit the children before the current node.

##Binary Heaps
Max Heap has the elements in descending order.<br/>
Mean Heap has the elements in ascending order.<br/>
Two key operations are:<br>
* Insert
* extract minimum
