String common
```
* find the shortest substring containing all the characters of another string. 
    * what if all strings are unique
    * what if they are not unique?
* largest window with unique strings
* group such that strings on one group doesn't exist in the others.
* longest palindrome substring
```
Notes:
```
* log(N)/log(10) or log N to the base 10 is equal to the number of digits of N.
* The && and || operators "short-circuit", meaning they don't evaluate the right hand side if it isn't necessary. The & and | operators, when used as logical operators, always evaluate both sides.

```
Sorting
```
* topological sort.
