Process all nodes of a tree by processing the root, then recursively processing all subtrees. Also known as prefix traversal.
~~~
In-Order Traversal
~~~
Process all nodes of a tree by recursively processing the left subtree, then processing the root, and finally the right subtree.
~~~
Post-Order Traversal
~~~
Process all nodes of a tree by recursively processing all subtrees, then finally processing the root. Also known as postfix traversal.
